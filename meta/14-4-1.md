indicator: 14.4.1
indicator_definition: The indicator Proportion of fish stocks within biologically
  sustainable levels measures the sustainability of the world's marine capture fisheries
  by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level,
  that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically
  sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is
  considered biologically unsustainable.

sdg_goal: '14'
target: By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported
  and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based
  management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible,
  at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their
  biological characteristics

  Illegal fishing violation- a violation of the established fishing rules, which does not represent an offence, and which is sanctioned with an administrative fine, the amount of which is established in contravention units and varies for individuals and legal entities depending on how severe the violation was (art. 114, para. 2 of the Contravention Code No. 218 of 24.10.2008)<br>

  Unlike the global indicator which refers to fish reserves at sustainable biological levels in ocean and maritime areas, the national indicator refers to protection and maintaining the fish reserves at sustainable biological levels in the country's water bodies
