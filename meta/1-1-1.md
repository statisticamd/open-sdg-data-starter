  Proportion of population below the international poverty  line of $2,15 a day, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural))
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of population with monthly average incomes per person smaller than the value of international poverty line ($2.15 per person, per day, PPP), during the period of reference / total number of population during the year of reference *100
computation_definitions: >-
  Share of population with income under $2.15 per person, per day, PPP (Purchasing Power Parity). <br> 
  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a method used to calculate an alternative exchange rate between the currencies of two countries. PPP measures the purchasing power of one currency  in an international unit of measurement (usually, dollars), because goods and services have different prices in some countries as compared to other countries.<br> 
  The poverty line of $2.15 has been regulated in the RM [Government Decision No. 288](http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view=doc&lang=1&id=300778)  dated 15.03.2005 approving the Millennium Development Goals in the Republic of Moldova for 2015 and<br> 
  [The First National Report  "Millennium Development Goals in the Republic of Moldova"](http://md.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/moldova/docs/pub/mdg/first%20mdg%20rom.pdf)<br> 
  Annually NBS provides the World Bank the HBS database for additional calculations at the global level (global poverty).<br>
