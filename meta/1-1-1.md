  Proportion of population below the international poverty  line of $2,15 a day,
  by sex,  age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of population with monthly average incomes per person smaller than the
  value of  international poverty line ($2.15 per person, per day, PPP), during
  the period of  reference / total number of population during the year of
  reference *100
computation_definitions: >-
  Share of population with income under $2.15 per person, per day, PPP
  (Purchasing Power Parity).  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a method used to
  calculate an alternative exchange  rate between the currencies of two
  countries. PPP measures the purchasing power of one  currency  in an
  international unit of measurement (usually, dollars), because goods and 
  services have different prices in some countries as compared to other
  countries. The poverty line of $2.15 has been regulated in the RM [Government
  Decision No. 288  dated 15.03.2005 approving the Millennium Development Goals
