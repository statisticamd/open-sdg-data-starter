indicator: 7.1.2
indicator_definition: "Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels\
  \ and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies\
  \ for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any\
  \ cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. \u201CClean\u201D is defined\
  \ by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed\
  \ coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor\
  \ air quality: household fuel combustion."

  Proportion of households by primary energy sources used for domestic needs (cooking, heating), %
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of population using a certain energy source for domestic needs (such as cooking, heating) out of the total number of population using any energy sources for domestic needs. <br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  The following shall be considered as primary sources of energy: natural gas, petroleum (liquid) gas, electricity, fire wood, agricultural waste, biomass, other. Solid fuels are considered to be polluting and non modern, while the non-solid fuels are considered to be "clean". Solid fuels (such as wood, coal, agricultural waste) or kerosene associated with inefficient technologies / devices (open fire, individual ovens, space heaters or lamps) - are considered inefficient energy sources for cooking, heating and lighting and are associated with high levels of pollution within the household.<br> 
  Other: The "clean" energy source is defined depending on the emission rate of the respective energy sources - [see WHO Guide on quality of indoor air: burning of domestic fuel](https://www.who.int/airpollution/guidelines/household-fuel-combustion/en/). [WHO database](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.SDGFUELS712?lang=en)

  IN -  the share of population using energy sources for domestic needs, like cooking and/or heating the dwelling, without making a difference between "clean" energy sources (as there is no national definition in the legislation in force)
