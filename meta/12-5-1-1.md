  Volume of generated (production and consumption) waste <br> 
  Form No.1-toxic waste is submitted by economic units in whose activity toxic waste is generated, stored, used, and neutralised (liquidated). It does not include the import and export of toxic waste.
computation_definitions: >-
  Recycling (use): reintroduction in the economic circuit of waste as raw material, secondary material and their use after being processed as semi-manufactured, end products or energy.<br> 
  Treatment  of waste is the operation of harnessing or elimination, including the process of preparing prior to harnessing or elimination. <br> 
  Harnessing means any operation which ends with the fact that the waste serves for a useful purpose by replacing other materials which were used for a certain purpose or the fact that the waste is prepared so as it can serve the respective purpose in enterprises or in economy in general (annex 2 of the Law 209/2016 on Waste).<br> 
  Disposal of waste is any operation which is not harnessing even when one of its secondary consequences would be the recovery of substances or energy (Annex 1, Law 209/2016 on Waste). (according to the European Directive).
