  10.1.1.b. Consumption expenditures growth rate of the bottom 40% of the population
computation_calculations: >-
  The average growth rate of consumption expenditures per person  – represents the evolution over time of consumption expenditures of bottom 40% of the population for a period of 5 years. To calculate it, two values of the same indicator are used, registered in different time units.<br> 
  To calculate the indicator: <br> 
  1. the average consumption expenditures are estimated per 1 person out of the bottom 40% of the population for the years T0 and T1; <br> 
  2. afterwards the annual average growth rate is calculated for the consumption expenditures in between these years according to the formula [[(average in T1) / (average in T0) ^ (1 / (T1-T0))] - 1] * 100.<br> 
  bottom 40% of the population represent the population from quintiles I-IV with the lowers expenditures.
