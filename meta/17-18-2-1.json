To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens\u2019 entitlement to public information. <br>  Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific  principles  and  professional  ethics,  on  the  methods  and  procedures  for  the  collection,  processing,  storage  and  presentation of statistical data.<br>  Principle 3. To  facilitate  a  correct  interpretation  of  the  data,  the  statistical  agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics.<br>  Principle 4. The  statistical  agencies  are  entitled  to  comment  on  erroneous  interpretation and misuse of statistics.<br>  Principle 5. Data  for  statistical  purposes  may  be  drawn  from  all  types  of  sources,  be  they  statistical  surveys  or  administrative  records.  Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents.<br>  Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation,  whether  they  refer  to  natural  or  legal  persons,  are  to  be  strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.<br>  Principle 7. The  laws,  regulations  and  measures  under  which  the  statistical  systems operate are to be made public.<br>  Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system.<br>  Principle 9. The  use  by  statistical  agencies  in  each  country  of  international  concepts,  classifications  and  methods  promotes  the  consistency  and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.<br>  Principle 10.
