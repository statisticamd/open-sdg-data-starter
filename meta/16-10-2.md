  The indicator is calculated based on quantitative and qualitative data, which are generated based on analysis of existing studies (such as: UNESCO reports regarding the world trends in freedom of expression and media development, etc.), administrative data, experts' analyses (for instance: World Justice Index of Open Government), etc. The following key variables will be evaluated:<br> 
  1. If the country has constitutional, statutory and/or political guarantees for public access to information?<br> 
  2. If these constitutional, statutory and/or political guarantees reflect the well-known international agreements (for instance, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, etc.)?<br> 
  3. What are the implementation mechanisms which secure that these guarantees operate in an optimal way?<br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  Freedom of information - an important element of freedom of expression, which includes the right to receive, as well as to distribute information, opinions, ideas, being a general desideratum at the international level. Public authorities, according to the held mandates, are obliged to ensure the correct information of citizens about the public matters and problems of personal interest. The adequate regime of freedom of information is a vital aspect of the activity of an open government and society democratization. Only when there is a free exchange of information, accountability may be ensured, corruption may be avoided at the power levels, and the right of the citizens to know may be met.
