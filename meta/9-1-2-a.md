computation_calculations: >-
  Freight record = amount obtained by multiplying the weight in tons of the
  transported freight by modes of transport (air, road, railroad, river) *
  distance in km travelled by the respective freight/cargo. <br>  Note: global
  metadata recommend reporting the indicator regarding the railroad transport
  only on the territory of the country. The national indicator on railroad
  transportation may be reported both for the territory of the country, as well
  as for the territory outside the country.
computation_definitions: >-
  Freight record is determined depending on the weight of the transported
  freight and the distances travelled by the vehicles transporting the freight,
  from the loading place (expedition) until the unloading place (destination).
computation_units: million ton-km
