The questionnaire is composed on 87 questions and is translated into 20 languages. Qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data regarding abuses and violence against journalists during the evaluated period. The evaluation criteria and indicators from the questionnaire are: 1) pluralism; 2) independence of mass-media; 3) \"self-censorship\" existence and environment; 4) legislative framework; 5) transparency, and 6) quality of infrastructure supporting information production. Starting with the Index for 2013, countries are attributed scores between 0 and 100, where 0 is the possible score and 100 is the weakest score. This makes the Index to be more informative and makes easier the comparability of one year with another. <br>  In 2017 and 2018 the Republic of Moldova got the ranking of 81 out of 180 with a value of the score of 30,41 and respectively 30,01.","computation_units":"Score","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"16.10.1.1 Press Freedom Index","source_data_source_1":"[see here](https://rsf.org/en/ranking#)","source_data_supplier_1":"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is an independent NGO with consultative status with the United Nations, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Council of Europe and the International Organization of the Francophonie (OIF)","source_organisation_1":"Reporters Without Borders (RSF)","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"1.National Council for Human Rights<br>  2.Parliamentary committee for human rights and inter-ethnic relations","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-08-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/cf4fa047776aefdaea1c2ec2fb7e36bf015a17da","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-08-22: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/9a114beed512075c93daa60b3072cfde1fa90227","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-10-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 1361kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"16.10.1","indicator_name":"Number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights advocates in the previous 12 months","indicator_sort_order":"16-10-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/16-10-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"16","target":"Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements","target_id":"16.10","graph_title":"Number of verified cases of killing, kidnapping, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture of journalists, associated media personnel, trade unionists and human rights advocates in the previous 12 months","un_custodian_agency":"Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)","un_designated_tier":"2","previous":"16-9-1","next":"16-10-2","page_content":""}}
