Stunting in children reflects a chronic nutritional deficiency and result in insufficient adequate dietary input for a long period of time, of recurrent or chronic disease, as well as of poor social-economic conditions. The indicator is measured according to the WHO Standards for Child Growth. Calculation formula: Number of children, aged under 5 years old, whose height for the respective age is smaller by two standard deviation from the median reference population, out of the total number of children aged under 5 years old.","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-06-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/2727c99dd477f1c79332e0d6f5cf6ea6348df24f","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-22: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/20045843a1bd8067f675e535f2e519cfddb12d4b","page_content":"","ro":{"indicator":"2.2.1","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/2-2-1/","sdg_goal":"2","data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 232kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age","indicator_sort_order":"02-02-01","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","target":"By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons","target_id":"2.2","graph_title":"Prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age","un_custodian_agency":"UNICEF","un_designated_tier":"1","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","previous":"2-1-2","next":"2-2-2","page_content":""}}
