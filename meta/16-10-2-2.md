  16.10.2.2 ICT sector development index (IDI)
computation_definitions: >-
  It is an aggregated index, which combines 11 indicators in one single measure of reference. It is used to monitor and compare the developments in ICT sector among countries over time.<br> 
  IDI is divided in the following three sub-indexes and a total number of 11 indicators:<br> 
  1. Access sub-index: this sub-index reflects the ICT availability and includes five indicators of infrastructure and access (subscription to land line telephony, subscription to mobile line telephony, international broadband for Internet users, households with computers and households with access to Internet).<br> 
  2. Usage sub-index: this sub-index reflects the ICT intensity and includes three indicators of intensity and use (persons using Internet, landline subscriptions in broadband and mobile line subscriptions in broadband).<br> 
  3. Skills sub-index: this sub-index aims to reflect the capacities and the skills which are important for ICT. It includes three proxy indicators (average schooling years, gross coverage in general secondary education and tertiary secondary education). As these are proxy indicators, and not indicators which measure directly the ICT related skills, not so much attention is paid to the skills' sub-index when calculating the IDD and the other two sub-indexes.
