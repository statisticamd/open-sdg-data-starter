  The "Social Allowance / Ajutor Social" Program has been implemented since 2008
  and it is composed of two main components – social allowance and the
  assistance for the cold period of the year. The aim of the program is to
  ensure the poor families with a guaranteed minimum monthly income (GMMI) which
  is established annually based on the State Budget. The eligibility for the
  benefits from the "Social Allowance / Ajutor Social" Program is determined
  based on the Methodology for assessing the monthly average global income of
  the family and the need for social assistance (a set of Proxy indicators).
  (Law No. 133/2008 on Social Allowance - Ajutor Social).
