(if yes, how many?) 6) Does the humanitarian policy of the Government include measures related to forced movement of persons, [see module III](https://esa.un.org/poppolicy/inquiry.aspx)<br>  All the subcategories, except for the ones from area 1, have Yes/No answers, coded with \u201e1\u201d for Yes and  \u201e0\u201d for No. For subcategories from area 1, there are three possible answers: \u201eYes, regardless of the immigration status\u201d, coded \u201e1\u201d; \u201eYes, only for those with legal immigration status\u201d, coded  \u201e0,5\u201d; and No coded \u201e0\u201d.","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"10.7.2.1 Existence of efficient national policies on migration","source_data_source_1":"1) UN Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development,  <br>  2) UN DESA Global Survey, module III which refers to migration policies","source_data_supplier_1":"1.Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection<br>  2.Bureau for Migration and Asylum<br>  3.General Inspectorate of Border Police","source_organisation_1":"1.Permanent Mission of the Republic of Moldova to the United Nations Office in Geneva <br>  2.United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"Permanent Mission of the Republic of Moldova to the United Nations Office in Geneva","source_periodicity_1":"Once every 2 years","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-08-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/92e88049dd4a156f0e0e49542f2b126dfb7018ce","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/2ca4c43c77db27fb00a53cd1272bc6e1fdb43b1a","page_content":"","ro":{"indicator":"10.7.2.1","layout":"indicator","permalink":"10-7-2-1","sdg_goal":"10","data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-10.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 564kB)","graph_type":"line","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","target_id":"10.7","un_custodian_agency":"DESA Population Division,IOM","un_designated_tier":"2","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","target":"Facilitarea migra\u021biei \u0219i mobilit\u0103\u021bii ordonate, sigure, reglementate \u0219i responsabile a persoanelor, inclusiv prin implementarea unor politici de migra\u021bie planificate \u0219i bine gestionate","indicator_name":"Existen\u021ba de politici na\u021bionale eficiente privind migra\u021bia","indicator_sort_order":"10-07-02-01","previous":"10-7-2","next":"10-7-2-2","tags":["custom.national"],"national_indicator_available":"10.7.2.1 Existen\u021ba de politici na\u021bionale eficiente privind migra\u021bia","national_geographical_coverage":"Republica Moldova","graph_title":"10.7.2.1 Existen\u021ba de politici na\u021bionale eficiente privind migra\u021bia","source_data_source_1":"1) UN Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development,  <br>  2) Chestionarul global UN DESA, modulul III care se refera la  politici migra\u021bionale","source_data_supplier_1":"1) Ministerul S\u0103n\u0103t\u0103\u021bii, Muncii \u0219i Protec\u021biei Sociale<br>  2) Biroul Migra\u021bie \u0219i Azil<br>  3) Inspectoratul General Poli\u021bia de Frontier\u0103","source_organisation_1":"1) Reprezentan\u021ba permanent\u0103 a Republicii Moldova pe l\u00e2ng\u0103 oficiul ONU din Geneva <br>  2) Departamentul Afaceri Economice \u0219i Sociale al ONU (Departamentul Afaceri Economice \u0219i Sociale al ONU (UNDESA))","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"Reprezentan\u021ba permanent\u0103 a Republicii Moldova pe l\u00e2ng\u0103 oficiul ONU din Geneva","source_periodicity_1":"o dat\u0103 la 2 ani","page_content":""}}
