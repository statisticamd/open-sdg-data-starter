  .a Global food loss index

  a) The food loss index is calculated as a ratio between the food loss percentage in the current year and the food loss percentage in the baseline year. <br> 
  FAO suggests defining the food losses to be measured within the SDG 12.3.1 (a) indicator, as follows: loss of food products represents all the quantities of plant and animal edible goods, which directly or indirectly, derive completely from post-harvest production / slaughtered production  / supply chain, being thrown, incinerated or other, and do not re-enter any other use (such as food for animals, industrial use, etc.), up to and excluding the level of retail sale. Hence, all the losses are included that occur during the storage, transpiration and processing, as well as imported quantities. The losses include the goods in general together with their inedible parts.<br>
