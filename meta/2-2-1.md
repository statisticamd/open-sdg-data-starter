  Prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years old
computation_calculations: >-
  Number of children, aged under 5 years old, whose height for the respective age is smaller by two standard deviation from the median reference population, out of the total number of children aged under 5 years old.  
computation_definitions: >-
  Height for age is an index of the linear growing, and a smaller height for the respective age is considered to be stunting. Stunting in children reflects a chronic nutritional deficiency and result in insufficient adequate dietary input for a long period of time, of recurrent or chronic disease, as well as of poor social-economic conditions. The indicator is measured according to the WHO Standards for Child Growth.
