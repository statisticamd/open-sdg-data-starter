computation_definitions: >-
  Definition: height for age is an index of the linear growing, and a smaller
  height for the respective age is considered to be stunting. Stunting in
  children reflects a chronic nutritional deficiency and result in insufficient
  adequate dietary input for a long period of time, of recurrent or chronic
  disease, as well as of poor social-economic conditions. The indicator is
  measured according to the WHO Standards for Child Growth.  Calculation
  formula: Number of children, aged under 5 years old, whose height for the
  respective age is smaller by two standard deviation from the median reference
  population, out of the total number of children aged under 5 years old.
