  16.7.1.a. Ratio between the proportion of seat taken in the Parliament by
  persons from certain groups of population (by sex, age, persons with
  disabilities and other corresponding groups) and proportion of the respective
  group in total population

  For single-chamber parliaments, just like the one in the Republic of Moldova,
  the indicator is measured through 4 sub-indicators (1 for the young population
  and 3 for women), of which 2 are calculated as rates and 2 are presented as
  absolute numbers: <br>  1) Rate 1 = Proportion of members in the Parliament
  aged 45 years old out of the proportion of population aged 45 years old and
  lower with the right to vote (18 years old +) *100.<br>  where:<br> 
  Numerator: Number of MPs aged 45 years old and lower out of total number of
  MPs. <br>  Denominator: Subtraction from the total number of the country
  population with the right to vote (18 years old +) of the total number of
  population up to the eligibility age.<br>  2) Rate 2 = Proportion of women /
  men in the Parliament out of the proportion of women / men in total population
  with the right to vote (18 years old +)<br>  where:<br>  Numerator: Number of
  women MPs / men MPs in the Parliament out of the total number of MPs in the
  Parliament *100<br>  Denominator: Proportion of women/men with the right to
  vote (aged 18 years old +) out of the total number of population up to the
  eligibility age.<br>  3) President of the Parliament: is not calculated, as
  there is only one President in the Parliament, being registered only his/her
  individual characteristics, meaning: age group and sex.<br>  4) Chairs of
  parliamentary standing committees (Public Administration Committee;
  Agriculture and Food Industry Committee; Culture, Education, Research, Youth,
  Sport, and Mass-media Committee; Public Finance Control Committee; Human
  Rights and Interethnic Relations Committee; Economy, Budget and Finance
  Committee; Legal, Appointments and Immunities Committee; Environment and
  Regional Development Committee; Foreign Policy and European Integration
  Committee; Social Protection, Health and Family Committee, and National
  Security, Defence and Public Order Committee): not calculated, as data are
  collected for the 11 chairs of the committees. Only their individual
  characteristics are registered, meaning: age group and sex.
computation_definitions: >-
  The indicator aims to compare the proportion of different demographic groups
  (depending on aged and sex) represented in the Parliament with the proportion
  of these groups in the national population with the right to vote. The right
  to elect and to be elected belongs to the citizens of the Republic of Moldova
  who have, including on the day of elections, the age of 18 years old, except
  for those deprived of this right as established by law (art. 11; 12 of the
  Electoral Code no. 1381/1997).

  Unlike the global indicator, whose sub-indicator 3 is calculated as an
  absolute number of chairs of 5 standing committees (Foreign Affairs, Defence,
  Finance, Human Rights and Gender Equality), the national indicator is
  calculated as an absolute number of 11 chairs of standing parliamentary
  committees established in the X legislature.
