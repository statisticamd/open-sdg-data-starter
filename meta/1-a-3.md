  The main aim of the social protection programs is to prevent and reduce poverty and social exclusion. Social insurance programs have the role to partially compensate such social risks as: old age, disease, maternity, work accidents and occupational diseases, disability and loss of bread-winner, the occurrence of which lead to reducing/losing the incomes and increasing the poverty risk (ILO Convention No. 102/1952 on Minimum Social Security Norms). At their turn, the social assistance programs, through the set of social benefits based on non-contribution principles and social services (primary, specialised, and highly specialised) have a significate role for reducing poverty and preventing social exclusion of different groups of persons. The share of expenditures for social protection of population in the GDP reflects the efforts undertaken by the state for redistributing the available resources for reducing population poverty. <br>
