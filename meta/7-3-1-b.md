  Final energy consumption is determined by summing up the quantities of energy
  resources used by final consumers in the economic activity carried out during
  the reference period. It covers the quantities of primary and processed energy
  resources used in consumer installations, as a result of which no further
  processing or transformation of energy takes place.
