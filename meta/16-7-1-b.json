Among the employees in \"first-line\" services the focus is on 4 categories: (1) Police personnel, (2) Personnel in education, (3) Personnel in health and (4) Administrative personnel at reception. Every category of \"first line\" services' employees will be further subdivided, using the same 4 levels defined for the bureaucratic positions. To calculate the indicator, the bureaucratic functions from the public service are transposed into occupational categories from the Classifier of Occupations in the Republic of Moldova (CORM 006-14) which is harmonised with ISCO-08. <br>  1) Heads (managers) are career public officials of high level (sometimes called as well General Directors), who are not appointed by the Government or Prime-minister, are at a lower level than Minister or Secretary, are not part of Cabinet of Ministers and not part of the group of lower level managers. Corresponding codes in CORM are: 1112, 1120, 112 .<br>  2) Specialists in different areas of activity (professionals), are officials who perform at central and local levels analytical, conceptual and practical tasks to support the activities of the Government of drafting policies and providing services. The corresponding codes in CORM for them are mainly 242, and possibly 21, 25, 26. <br>  3) Technicians and other specialists in technical area, are officials who carry out technical tasks related to governmental regulations and operations, such as: ensuring the observance and/or implementation of governmental regulations, accounting record keeping, development of human resources, specific secretariat activities, etc. Corresponding codes in CORM for them are: mainly 33, possibly 31, 34, 35.<br>  4) Administrative officials, are officials (in general without higher education) with general duties to register, organise, archive, assess and process information, perform secretariat works on financial operations, travel arrangements, requests of information and meetings. The corresponding code from CORM for them is: 42.<br>  Transposing functions of \"first line\" service officials into occupational categories in CORM is as follows:<br>  1) Personnel in police:  Heads -  1112, 121, 134.; Specialists in different areas of activity \u2013 241-242, 25; Technicians and other specialists in technical area \u2013 3355, 5412, 5413, 334.; Administrative officials \u2013 41;<br>  2) Personnel in education: Heads \u2013 121; 1345; Specialists in different areas of activity \u2013231-235; 241-242; Technicians and other specialists in technical area \u2013 531; 334;.
