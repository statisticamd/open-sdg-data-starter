The 13 components are placed on the same scale with a score from 0% to 100% . Every component is calculated separately and weighted in equal way. The score for each component is calculated as follows: ((Number of existing rights/Total number of rights) - (Total number of existing barriers / Total number of barriers))*100<br>  Total score for the indicator is calculated as an arithmetic average of the 13 component scores. The score for each thematic area is calculated in a similar way, meaning as an arithmetic average of the scores of its constitutive components.<br>  The global indicator is compiled by UNFPA, based on the data of UNFPA offices by the country which coordinates the carrying out of the survey and the process of data validation.","computation_definitions":"The aim of the indicator is to provide international comparability in line with the Action Plan of the Conference on Population and Development in 1994, the Action Plan of the Beijing Platform and international standards of human rights under implementation. The indicator tries to assess the extent to which the country has the set of legislative and normative acts guaranteeing full and equal access to women and men aged 15 years old and over to services of reproductive health, information and education. It represents a score on a scale from 0 to 100 (legislative and normative framework guaranteeing full and equal access), indicating thus the status and the progress of the country in relation to existence of legislative and normative frameworks, but not the level of their implementation.","computation_units":"Yes/no","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"5.6.2.1.
