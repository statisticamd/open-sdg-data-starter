  Average growth rate of consumption expenditures per capita – represents the evolution over time of consumption expenditures of population per entire country for a period of 5 years. To calculate is, two values are used of the same indicator registered in different time units.<br> 
  For calculating the indicator: <br> 
  1. the average consumption expenditures are estimated per 1 person in the country population for the years T0 and T1; <br> 
  2. afterwards the annual growth rate is calculated for the consumption expenditures between these years according to the formula [[(average in T1) / (average in T0) ^ (1 / (T1-T0))] - 1] * 100.
