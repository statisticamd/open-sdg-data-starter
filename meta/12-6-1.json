To calculate the indicator, they will consider the companies which publish sustainability information covering the following details on sustainability, which are divided into minimum and advanced criteria:<br>  1) Minimum criteria:<br>  Institutional and governance framework: \u2022 Material evaluation; \u2022 Sustainability strategy and / or sustainability-related principles; \u2022 Management approach to settle material subjects; \u2022 Governance structure, including for economic, environmental and social problems<br>  \u2022 Impacts, risks, key opportunities; \u2022 Practices for combatting fraud, anticorruption and anti-competition <br>  Economic: \u2022 Direct measurement of economic performance (revenues, net profit, added value, payments to shareholders); \u2022 Indirect measurement of economic performance (community investments, investments in infrastructure or other important local economic impact)<br>  Environmental:\u2022 Energy consumption and energy efficiency; \u2022 Waste use, wastewater generation, integrated practices for waster resources management or water recycling / reuse and efficiency; \u2022 Greenhouse gas emission; \u2022 Other emissions and effluents, including substances which destroy ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur oxides (SOX) and chemical substances; \u2022 Generation of waste, including hazardous waste; \u2022 Practices for minimizing and recycling waste; \u2022 Use and / or production of hazardous chemical substances <br>  Social: \u2022 Occupational health and security; \u2022 Total number of employees, depending on the type of contract and sex; \u2022 Training of employees; \u2022 Incorrect and illegal work practices and other aspects regarding human rights; \u2022 Diversity, equality of chances and discrimination in governance bodies and among employees; \u2022 Workers' rights and collective contracts.<br>  The respective methodology allows applying the principle \u201erespect or explain\u201d for the minimum standard, which allows the reporting entities to point out why certain information is not relevant for their companies and will make it more accessible for small companies.
