  Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development
  agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of
  poverty consistent with the country specific economic and social
  circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty
  rates.

  In 2016-2018, NBS has carried out a number of actions to identify the main
  non-monetary deprivations in the country's context: <br>  -  experimental
  calculations of multidimensional poverty with the help of AROPE indicator, the
  poverty risk rate or that of social exclusion (with some changes in the
  calculation methodology of the 3 dimensions of AROPE)/2016<br>  - calculation
  of multidimensional poverty index based on the Alkire-Foster methodology
  developed by the professors from Oxford University/2016<br>  - identification
  of relevant poverty dimensions for Moldova /2017 workshop with data
  users/,/2018 household survey to validate the dimensions/<br>  NEXT: Testing
  the algorithms for calculating the non-monetary poverty indicators: MPI,
  AROPE, including of multi-dimensional poverty of children <br>
computation_definitions: >-
  There is a number of international tools to measure multidimensional poverty,
  among which AROPE (Eurostat) and Alkire-Foster (Oxford Univer.) <br>  In the
  RM, the current estimation of poverty is based on absolute approach and
  consumption expenditures is the main indicator used to measure population
  wellbeing. But the monetary poverty should be completed with multidimensional
  poverty to describe as accurately as possible the poverty situation.<br>
