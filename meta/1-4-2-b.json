Although it would seem that the persons who do not hold any documents regarding the tenure rights to land may be frequently perceived as at risk, or that those who hold such documents are more protected, actually there might be situations in which even the holding of such documents cannot guarantee the security for tenure rights. On the contrary, even without legal documents, persons may feel themselves protected against deprivation or dispossession. Hence, the observation and analysis of such situations will allow better understanding the land security, based on the specific context of the country. <br>  For the purpose of producing the indicator, it is suggested to define the perceptions regarding the security of tenure rights to land if: (i) the right holder (respondent) does not state any fear regarding the involuntary loss of the land plot in the following five years because of, for instance, any threats/dangers within the family, community or of external nature and (ii) the right holder states that he/she has the right to transfer the land plot as inheritance.","computation_units":"Percent, %","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"1.4.2.b.
