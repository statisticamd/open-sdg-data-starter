  Civil Society Development Strategy for 2018–2020 (GD. 51/2018)  reflects the commitment of the Republic of Moldova to enhance systematically the conditions for dynamic development of the civil society. Being built on the principles of mutual trust, partnership, transparency, participation and political non-partisanship, the Strategy continues the efforts initiated within the implementation of the previous strategies for civil society development and focuses on the same priorities. Monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy is carried out through the tools envisaged in its section 5 "Monitoring and Evaluation of the Strategy”. The Government, in cooperation with the civil society organizations, submits annually to the Parliament, by the 31st of March, a report on implementation of the strategy and fulfilment of the action plan.<br>
