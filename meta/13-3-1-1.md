  13.3.1.1 Actions on integrating effects of  climate (mitigation, adaptation, reduction of impact and early warning) in primary, secondary and tertiary education curricula
computation_calculations: >-
  Actions are envisaged in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, Decision 15/CP.18, eight-year Doha work programme on Article 6 of the UNFCCC (2012 – 2020), par.22 g, 22f) for including the issues on climate change in the educational process and information of population. Paris Agreement (art.12) provides for the obligation of the parties to communicate about such actions within NDCs (nationally determined contributions). <br> 
  These are included/described in the National Communication on greenhouse gas emissions (once per 4 years), the updated [Biennial Report on greenhouse gas emissions](http://clima.md/).<br> 
  At the same time, the global methodology is missing, hence it is difficult to provide the description of the national indicator.
