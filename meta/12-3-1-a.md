computation_calculations: >-
  a) The food loss index is calculated as a ratio between the food loss
  percentage in the current year and the food loss percentage in the baseline
  year. <br>  FAO suggests defining the food losses to be measured within the
  SDG 12.3.1 (a) indicator, as follows: loss of food products represents all the
  quantities of plant and animal edible goods, which directly or indirectly,
  derive completely from post-harvest production / slaughtered production  /
  supply chain, being thrown, incinerated or other, and do not re-enter any
  other use (such as food for animals, industrial use, etc.), up to and
  excluding the level of retail sale. Hence, all the losses are included that
  occur during the storage, transpiration and processing, as well as imported
  quantities. The losses include the goods in general together with their
  inedible parts.
