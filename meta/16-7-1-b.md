  16.7.1.b. Ratio between the proportion of positions held in public
  institutions (central and local) by persons from certain groups of population
  (by sex, age, persons with disabilities, and other corresponding groups) and
  the proportion of the respective group out of total population
computation_calculations: >-
  Indicator is calculated in 2 steps:<br>  Step 1: Reporting of simple
  proportions of women, youth, persons with disabilities and specific groups of
  population from each occupational group from public service (according to CORM
  006-14), at the central national, and local levels:<br>  1) Proportion of
  women in public offices and "first line" services: Heads, Specialists in
  different areas of activity; Technicians and other specialists in the
  technical area; Administrative officials;<br>  2) Proportion of youth aged up
  to 34 years old in pubic offices and "first line" services: Heads, Specialists
  in different areas of activity, Technicians and other specialists in the
  technical area, Administrative officials;<br>  3) Proportion of persons with
  disabilities in public offices, in bureaucratic positions, and "first line"
  services: Heads, Specialists in different areas of activity, Technicians and
  other specialists in technical area; Administrative officials;<br>  4)
  Proportion of public officials in the group of population A (B; ex. Roma,
  etc.) <br>  Step 2: Generation of reports that would compared the proportion
  of women, youth, persons with disabilities and specific group of population,
  in public service as related to the proportion of the same group of
  population, per each professional category, at the national and local
  levels:<br>  1) Women's representation rate in bureaucratic positions and
  "first line" services: proportion of women - civil servants [ occupational
  group x] compared to the proportion of women in working-age population;<br> 
  2) Youth representation rate in bureaucratic positions and "first line"
  services: proportion of youth - civil servants, aged 34 years old and younger
  [occupational group x] as compared to the proportion of population aged 34
  years old and younger  (and over the eligibility age for working in public
  service);<br>  3) Persons with disabilities representation rate in
  bureaucratic positions and "first line" services: proportion of persons with
  disabilities - civil servants [occupation group x] compared to the proportion
  of persons with disabilities in the working age population;<br>  4)
  Representation rate of the population from group A (B; ex. Roma; etc.):
  proportion of civil servants from persons from group A  [occupational group x]
  compared to the proportion of persons from group A in working age population;
computation_definitions: >-
  This indicator measures the proportional representation of different
  demographic groups (women, youth, persons with disabilities, and relevant
  groups at the national level) through 4 groups of bureaucratic positions in
  the public service at the national, and local levels, and namely: (1) Heads
  (managers), (2) Specialists in different areas of activity (professionals),
  (3) Technicians and other specialists in the technical area and (4)
  Administrative officials. Among the employees in "first-line" services the
  focus is on 4 categories: (1) Police personnel, (2) Personnel in education,
  (3) Personnel in health and (4) Administrative personnel at reception. Every
  category of "first line" services' employees will be further subdivided, using
  the same 4 levels defined for the bureaucratic positions. To calculate the
  indicator, the bureaucratic functions from the public service are transposed
  into occupational categories from the Classifier of Occupations in the
  Republic of Moldova (CORM 006-14) which is harmonised with ISCO-08. <br>  1)
  Heads (managers) are career public officials of high level (sometimes called
  as well General Directors), who are not appointed by the Government or
  Prime-minister, are at a lower level than Minister or Secretary, are not part
  of Cabinet of Ministers and not part of the group of lower level managers.
  Corresponding codes in CORM are: 1112, 1120, 112 .<br>  2) Specialists in
  different areas of activity (professionals), are officials who perform at
  central and local levels analytical, conceptual and practical tasks to support
  the activities of the Government of drafting policies and providing services.
  The corresponding codes in CORM for them are mainly 242, and possibly 21, 25,
  26. <br>  3) Technicians and other specialists in technical area, are
  officials who carry out technical tasks related to governmental regulations
  and operations, such as: ensuring the observance and/or implementation of
  governmental regulations, accounting record keeping, development of human
  resources, specific secretariat activities, etc. Corresponding codes in CORM
  for them are: mainly 33, possibly 31, 34, 35.<br>  4) Administrative
  officials, are officials (in general without higher education) with general
  duties to register, organise, archive, assess and process information, perform
  secretariat works on financial operations, travel arrangements, requests of
  information and meetings. The corresponding code from CORM for them is:
  42.<br>  Transposing functions of "first line" service officials into
  occupational categories in CORM is as follows:<br>  1) Personnel in police: 
  Heads -  1112, 121, 134.; Specialists in different areas of activity –
  241-242, 25; Technicians and other specialists in technical area – 3355, 5412,
  5413, 334.; Administrative officials – 41;<br>  2) Personnel in education:
  Heads – 121; 1345; Specialists in different areas of activity –231-235;
  241-242; Technicians and other specialists in technical area – 531; 334;.
  Administrative officials – 41;<br>  3) Personnel in health: Heads -121; 1342;
  1343; Specialists in different areas of activity –22; 241-242; Technicians and
  other specialists in technical area – 32; 532; 3344; Administrative officials
  – 41;<br>  4) Administrative personnel at reception: Heads -112; 121;
  Specialists in different areas of activity – 25; 241-242; Technicians and
  other specialists in technical area – 334;335; Administrative officials – 41;
