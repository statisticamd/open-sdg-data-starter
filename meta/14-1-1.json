Eutrophication of waterbeds is favoured by such factors as: presence of some compounds originating from wastewater, nutrient species with nitrogen and phosphorus, biodegradable organic compounds (light and temperature). Chemical indices of eutrophication are: 1) production of biomass, mg/l; 2) content in dissolved oxygen, mg/l; 3) content of nitrogen and phosphorus; 4) ratio between the chemical consumption of oxygen (CCOMn) and concentration in dissolved oxygen; 5) ratio of mineral nitrogen and total phosphorus = 10.
