indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator is a measure of relative income poverty at the national level.
  It measures how far individuals are from the median standard of living,
  approximating a measure of social exclusion. Persons living in relative
  poverty often experience many other forms of social and economic disadvantage
  through unemployment, poor housing, inadequate health care and barriers in
  accessing education and economic, social, political and cultural activities,
  which can result from social stigmatisation.

  Proportion of persons living under  50% of expenditures of median
  consumption.<br>  Number of persons with monthly average consumption
  expenditures per person smaller than  50% of the monthly average consumption
  expenditures per one median person, out of the total number of population,
  multiplied by 100.<br>  The measurement is carried out in two stages: <br>  -
  first of all, 50% of the monthly average consumption expenditures per one 
  median person is estimated;<br>  - afterwards the proportion of persons living
  under this relative line is estimated. <br>  Note: This indicator may be
  estimated also according to the disposable incomes. Since 2014, the number of
  population with ordinary residence and not the number of stable population has
  been used as basis for estimating the indicator.
