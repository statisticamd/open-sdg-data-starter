  The 10 Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted by the UN
  Statistical Commission during the plenary session on April 11-15, 1994
  are:<br>  Principle 1: Official  statistics  provide  an  indispensable 
  element  in  the  information  system  of  a  democratic  society,  serving 
  the  Government,  the economy and the public with data about the economic,
  demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official
  statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made
  available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour
  citizens’ entitlement to public information. <br>  Principle 2. To retain
  trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide
  according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific 
  principles  and  professional  ethics,  on  the  methods  and  procedures 
  for  the  collection,  processing,  storage  and  presentation of statistical
  data.<br>  Principle 3. To  facilitate  a  correct  interpretation  of  the 
  data,  the  statistical  agencies are to present information according to
  scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the
  statistics.<br>  Principle 4. The  statistical  agencies  are  entitled  to 
  comment  on  erroneous  interpretation and misuse of statistics.<br> 
  Principle 5. Data  for  statistical  purposes  may  be  drawn  from  all 
  types  of  sources,  be  they  statistical  surveys  or  administrative 
  records.  Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to
  quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents.<br>  Principle 6.
  Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical
  compilation,  whether  they  refer  to  natural  or  legal  persons,  are  to 
  be  strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.<br> 
  Principle 7. The  laws,  regulations  and  measures  under  which  the 
  statistical  systems operate are to be made public.<br>  Principle 8.
  Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to
  achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system.<br>  Principle
  9. The  use  by  statistical  agencies  in  each  country  of  international 
  concepts,  classifications  and  methods  promotes  the  consistency  and
  efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.<br>  Principle 10.
  Bilateral  and  multilateral  cooperation  in  statistics  contributes  to 
  the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries.
