This option suggest using the minimum criteria defined as elements of the so-called DRR Progress Index. It measures the level to which the DRR National Strategy meets the four elements defined in para. 27 (b) of the Sendai Framework, which are: \u200b\u200ba) setting the timeframe, targets and indicators, b) sets the objectives and the measures for preventing the occurrence of disaster risks (c) sets objectives and measures related to reducing the existing risks and (d) sets the objectives and the measures for enhancing economic, social, health, and environment resilience. Every element is attributed 0.25 (25%). If a country has a DRR strategy which meets the four elements, it is assessed with 1. If a country reports missing DRR strategy, it is assessed with 0. If a country has an emergency or preparedness plan, which has objectives and measures related to enhancing the economic, social, health, and environmental resilience, but which does not tackle the prevention of risk occurrence and reduction of existing risks and also has no objectives and indicators, it is assessed with 0.25.<br>  [See the methodology for Global Indicator](https://www.preventionweb.net/documents/oiewg/Technical%20Collection%20of%20Concept%20Notes%20on%20Indicators.pdf), pag. 148-149","computation_units":"Index","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"13.1.2.2  Implementation level of the national strategic disaster risk reduction framework in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030","source_data_source_1":"National Progress Report on Sendai Monitor, reported to UNISDR","source_data_supplier_1":"Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment","source_organisation_1":"1.Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment<br>  2.United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)","source_responsible_monitoring_1":"1.Ministry of Agriculture, Regional Development and Environment<br>  2.United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)","source_periodicity_1":"Once every 2 years","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-08-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/92e88049dd4a156f0e0e49542f2b126dfb7018ce","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-08-22: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/statisticamd/open-sdg-data-starter/commit/9a114beed512075c93daa60b3072cfde1fa90227","page_content":"","ro":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-05-03.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 759kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"13.1.2","indicator_name":"Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030","indicator_sort_order":"13-01-02","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/13-1-2/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"13","target":"Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries","target_id":"13.1","graph_title":"Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030","un_custodian_agency":"UNISDR","un_designated_tier":"2","previous":"13-1-1","next":"13-1-3","page_content":""}}
