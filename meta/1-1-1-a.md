  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a method used to calculate an alternative
  exchange rate between the currencies of two countries. PPP measures the
  purchasing power of one currency  in an international unit of measurement
  (usually, dollars), because goods and services have different prices in some
  countries as compared to other countries'.<br> Poverty line of 4.3$ was
  established in the [second National Report  ""Millennium Development Goals in
  the Republic of
  Moldova""]<br>(http://md.one.un.org/content/dam/unct/moldova/docs/pub/mdg/second%20mdg%20rom.pdf)
  Annually, NBS provides the World Bank the HBS database for additional
  calculations at the global level (global poverty).
