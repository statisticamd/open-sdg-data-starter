This option suggest using the minimum criteria defined as elements of the so-called DRR Progress Index. It measures the level to which the DRR National Strategy meets the four elements defined in para. 27 (b) of the Sendai Framework, which are: \u200b\u200ba) setting the timeframe, targets and indicators, b) sets the objectives and the measures for preventing the occurrence of disaster risks (c) sets objectives and measures related to reducing the existing risks and (d) sets the objectives and the measures for enhancing economic, social, health, and environment resilience. Every element is attributed 0.25 (25%). If a country has a DRR strategy which meets the four elements, it is assessed with 1. If a country reports missing DRR strategy, it is assessed with 0. If a country has an emergency or preparedness plan, which has objectives and measures related to enhancing the economic, social, health, and environmental resilience, but which does not tackle the prevention of risk occurrence and reduction of existing risks and also has no objectives and indicators, it is assessed with 0.25.<br>  [see the methodology for Global Indicator](https://www.preventionweb.net/documents/oiewg/Technical%20Collection%20of%20Concept%20Notes%20on%20Indicators.pdf), pag. 148-149","computation_units":"Index","national_geographical_coverage":"Republic of Moldova","graph_title":"1.5.3.2.
