  Existence of regulatory documents and measures to prevent and decrease the appearance of invasive species to control and eradicate priority species. <br> 
  This indicator is calculated by international institutions with duties in the area based on four sets of data which annually are updated by countries. The reports submitted to the Secretariat of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Berna,19 September 1979)  <br> 
  
computation_definitions: >-
  The aim of this indicator is to measures the trends from: <br> 
  Part A: Commitment of the country to relevant international agreements, especially:<br> 
  (1) National adoption of international policies relevant for alien invasive species.<br> 
  (2) Existence of: (a) national strategies to prevent and control alien invasive species; and<br> 
  (b) national legislation and policies relevant for alien invasive species.<br> 
  Part B: Transposition of political agreements in country's actions to implement policies and to prevent and control pro-actively invasive alien species IAS, and to allocate resources for these activities, and namely:<br> 
  (3) National allocation of resources to prevent or control invasive alien species. <br> 
  Conservation of natural habitats is one of the essential elements for protection of wild flora and fauna. In this context, the Republic of Moldova has included in its national policy a number of provisions regarding prevention of appearance and counteracting of invasive species, as follows: (i) Strategy on Biological Diversity of the Republic of Moldova and the Action Plan for implementing it (GD no. 274/2015);  (ii) Law on Vegetal Kingdom No. 239/2007;  (iii) Law on Animal Kingdom No. 439/1995.<br> 
  Reporting is focused on a number of criteria:<br> 
  • Necessary research and work as basis for protection, management and sustainable use of birds' populations;<br> 
  • Information on derogated species' conservation status;<br> 
  • Authority empowered to declare that conditions were met;<br> 
  • Risk conditions, circumstances, time and place for which exceptions are provided;<br> 
  • Justification for derogation of a species in unfavourable conservation condition;<br> 
  • Alternative solutions taken into consideration and scientific data to compare them, etc."
